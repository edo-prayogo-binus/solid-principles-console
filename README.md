# 🚀 Solid Principles Console

A **hands-on learning project** for understanding the **SOLID Principles** in C# with .NET.  
Perfect for beginners who want to see clean code in action!

---

## 📖 Overview

This project demonstrates the **five SOLID principles** using a simple console application:

| Principle | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **S** | **Single Responsibility Principle** – One class, one reason to change |
| **O** | **Open/Closed Principle** – Open for extension, closed for modification |
| **L** | **Liskov Substitution Principle** – Subtypes must be replaceable with their base types |
| **I** | **Interface Segregation Principle** – No class should be forced to implement unused methods |
| **D** | **Dependency Inversion Principle** – Depend on abstractions, not concretions |
